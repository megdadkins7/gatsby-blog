When I first started learning JavaScript and learned about reduce it literally... reduced me to tears.

Bad pun aside, I actually did spend a lot of time frustrated over this method. It constantly tripped me up, left me angry and flat out confused me. No matter what I read, saw, or listened to helped me understand what it did and how to use it.

After watching me wrestle with it for a week, my boyfriend (also a developer), stepped in to try and teach me.

The way he explained it finally, finally, FINALLY helped it click in my brain.
