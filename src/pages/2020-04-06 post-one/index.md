You've taken a big step and decided you wanted to learn how to code. Even better, you've decided to commit to front-end development. Smile, celebrate, and do a little dance.

Now what?

Where do you even start?

You've looked up "learn to code" and there's endless ads, resources, and sites competing for your attention. 

There really are plenty of resources to choose from. The best advice I can give is to take a look at a bunch of different sites, do some research, and test a few out to see what you personally like. However, because there are so many, sometimes it feels overwhelming to have to go through all of them.

So without further ado, here are some of *my* favorite resources that I've used to begin and continue my own learning.


1. <a href='https://www.freecodecamp.org/' target='_blank'>freeCodeCamp</a>

freeCodeCamp is where I started my journey. They made learning HTML and CSS a breeze. They split the screen into three parts: the lesson and task all the way to the left, the code editor to write  answers in the middle, and to the right shows the result of the code written. After completing their lessons on basic html, basic css, visual design, accessibility, responsive web design principles, css flexbox, and css grid there are 5 responsive web design projects to complete. After this it's time to submit projects for a certification in web design. They also offer certifications in javascript algorithms and data structures, front end libraries, data visualization, APIs and microservices, and information security and quality assurance. Beyond that, there are coding challenges for interview preparation. And yes, it's all free.

2. <a href='https://www.codecademy.com/learn' target='_blank'>Codecademy</a>

While freeCodeCamp offers hours of free coding lessons that helped me get started, Codecademy is where I really began to understand javascript. Codecademy comes with a price tag, but (depending on how quickly you learn) it isn't too steep. The Pro version of Codecademy is $19.99 a month and there is a free trial as well. The Pro version has access to the full Web Development path. At the start, this path works through html and css (which I used as a refresher) and javascript. Codecademy helped flesh out javascript and provided context for each task. After javascript they have units on the command line and on git. These are essential tools for any developer. By unit 10 Codecademy introduces React (one of the most popular front end libraries available). The React unit focuses on piecemeal leassons and ties it altogether with a full project at the end. Codecademy also offers a skill path for React. This can be completed in conjunction with the Web Development Path and add to an understanding of the library and more projects for a portfolio. From here, Codecademy moves to back end development using Express and SQL. They wrap up the path with teaching Test-Driven Development, which is a process on how to approach code.

3. <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/' target='_blank'>Mozilla Developer Network</a>

MDN is a consistently used network by many developers. Whereas freeCodeCamp and Codecademy give paths and lessons to follow, MDN is more of a database of web docs to search when a developer needs some reminding on how a given method, style, or other piece of code works. A common search on google would be "mdn reduce" or just "reduce" on the MDN site. The MDN page gives syntax, description, examples, and more. Personally, I've used it mostly for javascript especially when I forget how array methods work, but their network covers html, css, http, graphics, api/dom, browser extensions, and MathML as well.

4. <a href='https://css-tricks.com/' target='_blank'>CSS Tricks</a>

CSS Tricks has probably become one of my favorite resources in learning CSS. I've found their visuals on flexbox and grid invaluable because they actually *show* the results of code in graphic form. And even better for something like grid or flexbox they show every property and value, explain what they do, and show what they do. Like MDN there are no direct paths or lessons to complete and you can search the actual website for what you're looking for. Or tell google "css tricks flexbox". There are plenty of guides and videos to help with all styling needs. Their guides are my favorite and I almost always have one pulled up while I'm working on a project. 

5. <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/' target='_blank'>Stack Overflow</a>

Stack Overflow is a little scary as a newbie. It's kind of like reddit for developers where you can post a question for the community and other developers will answer. Or you can answer someone else's question. However before you post a question I'd caution you to look and see if a similar one has been posted before. Stack Overflow is great for questions that web docs from MDN or guides from CSS Tricks doesn't address because they're too specific. For searching Stack Overflow some of the best advice I can give is to format your searches as "language/library your problem/question" (i.e. "javascript how to check if string contains substring"). I've found many of the questions I have are already answered and if not, there are similar scenarios. Do your best to pull from those before you ask a question. If you do ask a question provide context *and* the code you are asking about so other developers can see it. Stack Overflow is a community where you develop a reputation, unlock badges, create a profile, and can even receive job recommendations so make sure you put your best foot forward here.

Learning to code is exciting especially when there are so many are great resources to help you get started. You don't have to be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of options. Take a deep breath, take some time to look at some resources, and don't forget to think about your learning style. You'll be on your way to coding in no time!
