# Personal Blog

A markdown powered blog to help self-taught developers. While there are a lot of how-to posts available to self-taught developers, I noticed a lack of content regarding developersâ€™ actual journeys.  I built this application to create an outline of my own journey, create relatable and honest content, and update the blog to continue sharing and helping others learn.
